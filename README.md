# Points, Lines and Systems

CREATING GENERATIVE ART WITH CODE. Taken during November 2021 as part of the [School of Machines](http://schoolofma.org/points-lines-systems.html).

This codebase is a snapshot of a daily practice, 30 - 60 minutes of drawing based on prompts. The class used the [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) framework as the basis of our programs.

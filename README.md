# Points, Lines and Systems

CREATING GENERATIVE ART WITH CODE. Taken during November 2021 as part of the [School of Machines](http://schoolofma.org/points-lines-systems.html).

This codebase is a snapshot of a daily practice, 30 - 60 minutes of drawing based on prompts. The class used the [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) framework as the basis of our programs.

## Prompts

### 1. Order, 9 or 99 lines

Your call if you want to work with 9 or 99!

### 2. Chaos, 9 or 99 lines

Also your call. If you feel up for it, try the one you haven't done in the first prompt.

### 3. Somewhere Between Order and Chaos

### 4. At Least 99 Identical Squares

Your definition of identical might be different than mine ðŸ˜‡

### 5. Gradual Change, Top to Bottom

What is the subject of change? Scale, density, negative space, how orderly everything is? Maybe the gradual change is in the code, not in the composition? Maybe this composition doesn't involve code at all -- could be a drawing, a video of a short performance, a speech, a letter.

### 6. 99 lines and 99 points

We didn't look at points in class, but you can draw a point by either drawing a very short line, or a very small square ðŸ™‚

### 7. Broken Grid

The grid is the ultimate symbol of modernism â€“ LET'S BREAK IT!!! ðŸ‘¹
